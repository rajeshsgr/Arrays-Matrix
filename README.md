#Bubble Sort Algorithm

In bubble sort, the array of integers is traversed from index 0 to length-1.

The value at 0th position is compared with the value at 1st position and if the later is small, it’s swapped.

The comparison is moved from the 0th index to length-1 index so that after the first iteration, the last index has the biggest value.

The same process is repeated again from 0th to length-1 index. After (length-1) iteration, the array is sorted.

In worst-case, the complexity of bubble sort is O(n2) and in best-case, the complexity of bubble sort is Ω(n).
